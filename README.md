# Undervoltage-Protection-System
I led a team to develop an Undervoltage Protection System. This system protects electrical circuits from low voltage conditions. We designed, tested, and implemented it carefully to make sure it works reliably and safely. For this project, we used a voltage sensor (ZMPT101B), Arduino UNO R3, 5V Relay, and an LCD display.
